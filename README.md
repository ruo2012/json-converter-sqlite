# JSON Converter for SQLite
A simple command line utility that converts an SQLite file to text based JSON

This is not meant to be an API and doesn't offer a lot of configurability. Just a quick way to dump a database into a JSON file for quick inspection or for integrating it into diff tools for on-the-fly conversions.
